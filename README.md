# AI-vs-Human-Text-Classifier
This project explores a simple logistic regression model to classify whether a given text was written by a human or generated by artificial intelligence (AI).

Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to build a baseline text classifier using logistic regression. The classification task focuses on distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written short texts.

The process includes:

    Data cleaning and preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering)

    Text vectorization (TF-IDF)

    Model training with Logistic Regression

    Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

This project is a first step and intended for educational use. Future improvements will include more advanced NLP models and feature engineering.

### Acknowledgment  
This project was also inspired by the book *Projelerle Yapay Zeka ve Bilgisayar ile Görü* by Ümit Aksoylu. The book’s practical project-based approach helped me understand key concepts, which I then adapted and implemented.
